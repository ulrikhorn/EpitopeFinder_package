# EpitopeFinder_package
Protein hydrophobicity predictor and epitope finder.
This package contains two functions. Hydrophobicity_predictor takes a protein sequence and predicts hydrophobic regions located within the protein structure. The Epitope_Finder function takes the hydrophobicity_predictor output and an IEDB export file and maps the epitopes in this file to the query protein sequence and evaluates if the matched epitopes are located in a hydrophobic or soluable region of the protein.

EpitopeFinder.tar.gz file can be installed directly in the package installer tool inside Rstudio. 
Alternatly, the git repository can be cloned into a new project if you wish to view or edit the functions inside the package. 

All instructions on the two functions can be accessed via the help files.
